## Change flow

The general flow for making a change to the script host is:
1. üëçüèª Make sure your Github account is in SSW Organization
2. üç¥ Fork the repo (add the fork via `git remote add me <clone url here>`
3. üå≥ Create a branch for your change (generally use dev) (`git checkout -b my-change`)
4. üõ† Make your change
5. ‚úîÔ∏è Test your changes
6. üìå Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'your commit message'`)
6. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Push your changes to your fork (`git push me my-change`)
7. üíå Open a PR to the dev branch
8. üì¢ Address feedback and make sure tests pass (yes even if it's an "unrelated" test failure)
9. ‚úÇÔ∏è Delete your branch (optional) 

## Definition of Done

- Code Compiles
- Check the Acceptance Criteria.
- Code is squash-merged to main via a pull request that was approved by a 2nd developer.
- Another team member agrees it‚Äôs ready for Production.
- Pushed to Production.
- Use @Mention (**OR** Send email) to notify Product Owner/PBI stakeholder that PBI is done (be sure to include screenshots/done video as proof) 

> <As per rule: [Done - Do you go beyond 'Done' and follow a 'Definition of Done'](https://rules.ssw.com.au/done-do-you-go-beyond-done-and-follow-a-definition-of-done)?>

## Deployment

üöÄ Once your Pull Request has been approved, your changes will get deployed to production automatically

## Running the Project

1. To run the web UI, open your terminal in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and type the following:  
``` bash
$ cd ui
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

2. To build your docker image, first make sure that Docker is running then type the following in your terminal:

```

3. To run the Firebase API, type the following in your terminal:
``` bash
$ cd api
$ npm i
$ npm run serve
```

## Testing your changes locally 
1. Front-End UI  
In order to test your code changes in the UI
- Make the changes in the **ui** folder
- Make sure the ui is already running (`npm run dev`)
- View the changes in your browser via `localhost:5000`

2. Docker  
In order to test your code changes in Docker 
- Make the changes in the **docker** folder
- Rebuild the Docker image (`docker build -t sswconsulting/codeauditor .`)
- Run CodeAuditor code in Powershell to see the changes (`$ docker run sswconsulting/codeauditor --token 3c34a549-dfb3-442c-b0e3-45942104a8bf --url <URL> --buildId [BUILDID]`) 

3. Firebase API  
In order to test your code changes in the API
- Make the changes in the **api** folder
- Run the api (`npm run serve`)
- View the changes in *console.firebase.google* (contact Anthony for authentication)
